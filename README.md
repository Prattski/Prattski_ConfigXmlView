Prattski_ConfigXmlView
======================

This module is meant to explore the settings found in config.xml files (module
configurations) in the community and local code pools.  The views for these can
be found in the systen configuration under "Prattski Modules".  Currently, this
module does the following:

* Lists all rewrites for Models, Blocks, and Helpers (in global node only)
* Lists all event observers (in global node only)


Todos:

* Add ability to list all rewrites/observers in the other nodes as well
* Make display of observer list look cleaner
